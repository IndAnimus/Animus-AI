Animus AI is an Open Source Artificial Intelligence Assisstant developed by Kuldeep Paul that focusses on the Versatile use of the Software for Home Automation, Security and Integration with the Home Automation Products available in the market. 

Unlike other AI assistants, Animus relies on many open source frameworks and itself promotes the development of the platform by the Open-Source Communities. Animus is developed to fullfill the needs of Home Automation and a digital assistant for the user.

        Pyttsx
        Pyaudio
        Wit
        Wolfram
