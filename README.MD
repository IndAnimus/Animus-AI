Animus-AI

Animus is an open source multi functional Artificial Intelligence Assistant designed to be flexible, cross-platform and remarkable. At Ind Incorporation, we believe a hundred cooks can definitely make the soup better. Animus draws a lot of its technology from open source technologies and platforms. While this version of Animus is stripped down of the Vision API presently under development, we hope innovators, coders and inventors would provide their insight and suggestions on how we can make Animus better. We have provided only the debugged Skills we developed for Animus, and have left out the Skills yet to be developed. The Source code cannot be run directly from the repository, you need to add your API Keys from the respective Platforms most of them are free. The goal behind open sourcing Animus is to let it be developed by the programming community. In case of any doubts or suggestions, please mail us at indincorporation@gmail.com. If you want to discuss about Animus at details, feel free to contact us, we would love to hear from you.
